This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Native applications. The issue arises when attempting to access a state variable or prop before it has been fully initialized, frequently in asynchronous scenarios (API calls, timers).  The solution focuses on leveraging asynchronous programming patterns (async/await or Promises) to ensure data is fetched and the state updated before rendering components dependent on it.
